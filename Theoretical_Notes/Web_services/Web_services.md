### **Web services**

+ It runs on web server like web application.

+ Methods of this service will be called remotely by front-end.

+ These methods are known as **Web-APIs.**

+ APIs can be of following two types:
  + SOAP APIs (Simple Object Access Protocol)
  + REST APIs (Representational State Transfer)

+ The REST APIs are build using Spring-Boot framework.

+ Any front-end application can call these APIs remotely.

+ Developing RESTful API is much easier than developing web applications.
