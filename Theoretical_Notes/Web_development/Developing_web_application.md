# DEVELOPING WEB APPLICATION

<br>

### **Developing web application**

+ To build dynamic web pages, either servlets or JSP technology or both are used.
+ Web servers are identified by their IP address and port number.

+ Every URL has four parts:
  + Protocol
  + IP address
  + Port number
  + Resource name

+ **Protocol:** It is the set of rules for communication. "http" stands for "Hyper-text Transfer Protocol".
+ **IP address:** The computers are uniquely indetified by their IP address.
+ **Local host:** Local host is used in place of an IP address when the client and server are on same system (computer).
+ **Port number:** It is the identification of the servers.
