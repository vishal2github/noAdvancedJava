# **DEVELOPING WEB-APPLICATION**

<br>

### **Developing web-application**

+ Static web pages can be build by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

+ To build dynamic web pages, either servlets, or JSP technology, or both are used.

+ Web servers are identified by their IP address and port number embedded in the URL.

+ URL stands for "Uniform Resource Locator", helps to uniquely indetify the web-pages.

```
  LOCAL-HOSTED URL FORMAT

    http://localhost:8080/mainApplication/home.jsp

    ‣ Protocol: http
    ‣ IP: localhost
    ‣ Port: 8080
    ‣ Resource: mainApplication/home.jsp
```

+ Every URL has four parts:
  + Protocol
  + IP address
  + Port number
  + Resource name

+ **Protocol:** It is the set of rules for communication. **http** stands for **Hyper-text Transfer Protocol**.

+ **IP address:** The unique identity of system over network.
  
  + **Local host:** Local host is used in place of an IP address when the client and server are on same system (computer).

+ **Port number:** An identification of the systems.
