# **JSP**

<br>

### **JSP**

+ **JSP** stands for **Java Server Pages**.

+ By using this technology, one can build "dynamic web pages".

+ Building web-application/dynamic web pages using JSP technology is much convenient than using servlet technology.

+ Every JSP page is translated into servlets by web-server, and this servlet is called an auto-generated servlet.

+ Inside JSP page, one can write HTML, CSS, and Java codes directly.

+ Entire code of JSP page will be inserted into "service method" of auto-generated servlet by the web-server.

+ Using JSP technology, one can write/inject HTML, CSS, and Java code in JSP pages to enhance the dynamic web-pages with logics.
  + While it wasn't possible in servlets HTML pages.

+ Writing Java code inside JSP page means writing code inside "service method" of an auto-generated servlet.
  + Hence, no need to make a separate servlet class, like in servlet technology.
