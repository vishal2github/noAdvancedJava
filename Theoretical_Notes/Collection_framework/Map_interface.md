# **MAP INTERFACE**

<br>

### **Map interface**

+ "Map" interface isn't a child of Collection interface, so it's not treated as collection.

+ Map is used to keep elements in key-value pair.

+ Key makes management of elements easy.

+ Key-value pairs inside map is called an entry.

  + This entry will always be unique and might be unordered.
  
  + Here, key will be unique and value can be duplicate.

+ Map interface has following two implementations:
  + HashMap class
  + LinkedHashMap class

<br>

### **HashMap class**

+ It creates and uses instance of "Map.Entry" to keep elements. (Entry interface is nested interface of Map)
